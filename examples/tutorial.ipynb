    "**Пропенсити** (propensity) — вероятность того, что политика A выберет действие `a` в контексте `x`: \\(\\pi_A(a|x)\\). Логи должны содержать эту вероятность для каждого показанного действия.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Нулевой пропенсити** — ситуация, когда \\(\\pi_A(a|x)=0\\); политика A никогда не выбирает действие `a` при таком `x`. Если политика B хочет выдать это действие, его эффект нельзя оценить на имеющихся данных.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Стохастическая политика** — политика, которая выбирает действия случайно, согласно распределению вероятностей. Примеры: `epsilon_greedy`, `softmax`. Противоположность — детерминированная политика, всегда отдающая одно действие.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value (ценность) политики** — ожидаемое значение целевой метрики при использовании политики. Например, средняя вероятность отклика или средний CLTV при показе действий по этой политике.\n"

    "- **Replay** — использует только совпадения между A и B; требует большого перекрытия действий.\n",
    "- **IPS** — корректен при известных пропенсити `π_A(a|x)` и `π_B(a|x)`; веса могут иметь большую дисперсию.\n",
    "- **SNIPS** — нормализует веса IPS, уменьшая дисперсию, но остаётся чувствителен к редким событиям.\n",
    "- **Direct Method (DM)** — строит модель исхода `μ(x,a)`; смещён, если модель неточна вне области наблюдений.\n",
    "- **Doubly Robust (DR)** — сочетает DM и IPS; достаточно корректности хотя бы одной из частей.\n",
